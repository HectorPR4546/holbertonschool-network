The blog post breaks down the full journey of `https://www.google.com` across DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls, TLS, load balancing, web tier, application tier, and storage.

The Mermaid diagram file shows the same path: browser --> DNS --> encrypted request through the firewall --> load balancer --> web server --> application server --> database and back. Render it using any Mermaid-capable viewer (for example https://mermaid.live) and export an image for submission.
